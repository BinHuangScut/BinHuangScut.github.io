- Machine Learning-power Battery Storage Modeling and Evaluation for Fast Frequency Regulation Service (11. 2019-present)
    
    **Southwest Research Institute and SMU**
    
    1. accurate model for battery based FFRS, which allows the integration of stationary/mobile batteries, renewable energy generation units as well as different energy demand patterns;
    2. battery safety control scheme, which can adopt different ancillary services and market mechanisms; 
    3. fully data-driven real-time optimal control strategies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning which can self-adjust according to the system and market dynamics.
- Hierarchical Multi-Objective Reactive Power Optimization and Decision Making for Large Scale Power Systems Considering the Resilience(11.2016-09.2018)
    
    **Power Dispatch and Control Center of Guizhou Power Grid at China Southern Power Grid Corp.**
    
    develop the software module of the network reduction, which can adaptively reduce the scale of the power system by eliminating the low voltage level buses.
     This module can scale to the practical power grid with more than 10,000 buses and has been launched in practice.
- Key Technologies for Simulation and Visualization of Global Energy Internet(05.2017-06.2019)
    
    **China Electric Power Research Institute** 
    
    research on the equivalence method of distributed generation in active distribution network considering uncertainty, which can not only significantly alleviate the computation and communication burden of the deregulated bulk system.
- Basic Theory and Methodology of  Planning and Operation of Integrated Energy System(09.2016-01.2017)
   
   **Energy Research Institute at South China University of Technology**
   
   research on the Benders decomposition method for the unit commitment in the integrated energy system, which enables nonlinear mixed integer programming by decomposing it into a master problem (mixed integer programming) and slave problem (nonlinear programming).
