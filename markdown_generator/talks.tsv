Capacity Scheduling of Battery Storage System for EV Charging and Frequency Regulation - A Proximal Policy Optimization Approach	Talk	talk-1	Energy Efficient Vehicle Sharing System Session	2020-11-08	INFORMS 2020 Virtual Annual Meeting	http://binhuangscut.github.io/files/INFORMS_2020_Virtual_Annual_Meeting.pdf	"Investor-owned battery storage systems (BSS) can gain revenue by providing stacked services, including EV charging and frequency regulation, and by performing energy arbitrage. Capacity scheduling (CS) is a crucial component of BSS energy management, aiming to ensure the secure and economic operation of the BSS. This presentation proposes a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to perform the CS of BSS. "
