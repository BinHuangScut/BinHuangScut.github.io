2018-05-01	"A Modified Ward Equivalent Based on Sensitivity Matrices for Static
Security Analysis"	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING	"This letter proposes a modified Ward equivalent method (M-Ward) for the static security analysis of electric network. The
M-Ward develops the external to boundary sensitivity matrices to track the change of the operation condition in the external
network. Hence, the M-Ward can guarantee the accuracy of the equivalent network along with the condition change of the
external network."	"Huang, Bin, et al. (2018). ""A modified Ward equivalent based on sensitivity matrices for static security analysis."" <i>IEEJ Transactions on Electrical and Electronic Engineering</i>. 13(11)."	J1	http://binhuangscut.github.io/files/J1.pdf
2018-11-06	An Equivalent Modeling Method for Multi-port Area Load Based on the Extended Generalized ZIP Load Model	2018 International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON 2018)	"To model the load area and simplify the electrical network, a multi-port area load equivalent modelling method (ALEEM) based on the extended generalized ZIP load model (EGZIP) is proposed. Different from the traditional ZIP load, the EGZIP load model incorporates the voltage magnitudes and voltage phase angles of all boundary buses, which can equivalently model the area load with multiple boundary buses more accurately."

2020-07-17	Probabilistic active distribution network equivalence with correlated uncertain injections for grid analysis	IET Renewable Power Generation	"Equivalent modelling for active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for improving the efficiency of analysing transmission networks. Current equivalent modelling methods for ADNs neglect the probabilistic characteristics of renewable energy sources (RESs) and loads. To address this issue, this study proposes a probabilistic equivalent modelling method (PEMM) for ADNs considering the uncertainty of RESs and loads. The uncertainty of the RESs and loads is transferred to the equivalent boundary bus injection using the properties of cumulant and power transfer matrices. The PEMM is extended to incorporate the correlations of RESs through an orthogonal transformation. A sampling method using the Gaussian copula function is employed to generate the correlated samples and the joint cumulants, providing the input data for the PEMM. The comparative results of the case studies on two different test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEMM. The equivalent model developed in this study is a practical solution for analysing the transmission network efficiently and taking the uncertainty of RESs and loads in the ADNs into account simultaneously."

2020-08-17	An Evidential Reasoning Based Approach to Building Node Selection Criterion for Network Reduction	arXiv	"A reasonable node selection criterion (NSC) is crucial
for the network reduction in power systems. In contrast to the
previous works that only consider structure property, this paper
proposes a comprehensive and quantitative NSC considering both
structural and electrical properties. The proposed NSC is developed
by employing the evidential reasoning approach, in which
the quasi-one-hot encoding is used to determine the evaluation
grades of different criteria or attributes. Then, different criteria
are combined through the multi-evidence reasoning. Eventually,
the utility evaluation is used to derive the quantitative NSC."	"Huang, Bin, et al. (2020). ""An Evidential Reasoning Based Approach to Building Node Selection Criterion for Network Reduction."" <i>arXiv</i>."	C3	http://binhuangscut.github.io/files/C3.pdf
2020-12-26	Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Capacity Scheduling for PV-Battery Storage System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID	"Investor-owned photovoltaic-battery storage systems
(PV-BSS) can gain revenue by providing stacked services, including
PV charging and frequency regulation, and by performing
energy arbitrage. Capacity scheduling (CS) is a crucial component
of PV-BSS energy management, aiming to ensure the secure
and economic operation of the PV-BSS. This paper proposes a
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) agent to perform the CS of PV-BSS."	"Huang, Bin, et al. (2020). ""Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Capacity Scheduling for PV-Battery Storage System."" <i>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID</i>."	J3	http://binhuangscut.github.io/files/J3.pdf
