title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Capacity Scheduling for PV-Battery Storage System"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-12-26-J3
excerpt: 'Investor-owned photovoltaic-battery storage systems
(PV-BSS) can gain revenue by providing stacked services, including
PV charging and frequency regulation, and by performing
energy arbitrage. Capacity scheduling (CS) is a crucial component
of PV-BSS energy management, aiming to ensure the secure
and economic operation of the PV-BSS. This paper proposes a
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) agent to perform the CS of PV-BSS.'
