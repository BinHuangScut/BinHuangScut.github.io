excerpt: 'This letter proposes a modified Ward equivalent method (M-Ward) for the static security analysis of electric network. The
M-Ward develops the external to boundary sensitivity matrices to track the change of the operation condition in the external
network. Hence, the M-Ward can guarantee the accuracy of the equivalent network along with the condition change of the
external network.'

This letter proposes a modified Ward equivalent method (M-Ward) for the static security analysis of electric network. The
M-Ward develops the external to boundary sensitivity matrices to track the change of the operation condition in the external
network. Hence, the M-Ward can guarantee the accuracy of the equivalent network along with the condition change of the
external network.
