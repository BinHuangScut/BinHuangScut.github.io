collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-11-06-C1
excerpt: 'To model the load area and simplify the electrical network, a multi-port area load equivalent modelling method (ALEEM) based on the extended generalized ZIP load model (EGZIP) is proposed. Different from the traditional ZIP load, the EGZIP load model incorporates the voltage magnitudes and voltage phase angles of all boundary buses, which can equivalently model the area load with multiple boundary buses more accurately.'
