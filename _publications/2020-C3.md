title: "An Evidential Reasoning Based Approach to Building Node Selection Criterion for Network Reduction"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/8/17/2020-C3
excerpt: 'A reasonable node selection criterion (NSC) is crucial
for the network reduction in power systems. In contrast to the
previous works that only consider structure property, this paper
proposes a comprehensive and quantitative NSC considering both
structural and electrical properties. The proposed NSC is developed
by employing the evidential reasoning approach, in which
the quasi-one-hot encoding is used to determine the evaluation
grades of different criteria or attributes. Then, different criteria
are combined through the multi-evidence reasoning. Eventually,
the utility evaluation is used to derive the quantitative NSC.'
