This paper proposes an equivalent modeling method (EMM) based on system measurements to reduce the scale of electrical network. In this method, the equivalent network model adopts a novel framework with boundary buses interconnected to improve the accuracy of equivalent network while maintaining the simplicity of the network structure.
