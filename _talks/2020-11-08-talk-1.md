Investor-owned battery storage systems (BSS) can gain revenue by providing stacked services, including EV charging and frequency regulation, and by performing energy arbitrage. Capacity scheduling (CS) is a crucial component of BSS energy management, aiming to ensure the secure and economic operation of the BSS. This presentation proposes a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to perform the CS of BSS.
