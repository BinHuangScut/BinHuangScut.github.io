<p>
I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering under the supervision of <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/People/Faculty/Wang-Jianhui">Dr. Jianhui Wang</a> at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, USA.
</p>

<p>
I received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2016, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from South China University of Technology, China, in 2019.
</p>

<p>
My research interests include but are not limited to:
<html>
<body>
    <ul>
    <li>Machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics for power systems</li>
    <li>Decision-making methods and their applications on smart grid</li>
    <li>Reinforcement learning for energy management and storage</li>
    <li>Probabilistic and stochastic methods in power system analysis</li>
    <li>Physics-informed neural networks and their applications in power systems</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
<p><strong>I am open to research discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email!</strong></p>

<p>
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Openings</span>: I am open to motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs. Feel free to drop me an email (<a href="mailto:bin@smu.edu">bin@smu.edu</a>) with the subject "<code>{PhD/Postdoc Application}-{Your Name}</code>" (e.g., PhD/Postdoc Application-Ming Li) with your CV, transcripts (for Ph.D. applicants; postdocs may omit), and representative publications (if any) attached, if you are interested. Please include a brief statement of motivation for joining the research group in the email.
