    My research focuses on <strong>machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, and decision-making methods</strong> with applications to smart grid and power systems. I am particularly interested in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Reinforcement learning</b> for energy management, storage scheduling, and capacity planning (e.g., PV-battery systems, microgrid storage expansion)</li>
    <li><b>Probabilistic and stochastic methods</b> for distribution network equivalence, static security analysis, and uncertainty quantification</li>
    <li><b>Physics-informed neural networks</b> and their applications in power system analysis</li>
    <li><b>Data-driven optimization</b> for grids with high renewable penetration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I work on deep reinforcement learning-based capacity scheduling, bi-level adaptive storage expansion, adaptive static equivalences for active distribution networks, and probabilistic equivalence with correlated uncertain injections. For more details, see my <a href="/publications/">publications</a>.
